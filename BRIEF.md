## Problem

Design constraint-respecting quantum artifacts that hit a target the judge can re-derive: a
circuit that **prepares a declared target state** (`state_prep`) or one that **minimizes the
energy of a declared Hamiltonian** (`vqe`), a hardware **topology** that routes a workload
(`architecture`), or a **feature map** that classifies data (`classify`). The hard part is not "find any circuit" — it is
finding a circuit that meets the bar *while honoring the physical constraints of a chip*:
a fixed qubit count, a depth budget, a native gate set, a coupling map (which qubit pairs can
physically interact), and a cap on two-qubit gates. A circuit that ignores those constraints
is not runnable on hardware and is rejected before its result is even scored.

This is the first rung of a longer ladder: constraint-respecting quantum primitives are the
building blocks for **native quantum-processing architectures for AI models and inference** —
beyond today's hybrid intermediate-representation / classical stack. We start with circuits
that prepare states and minimize Hamiltonian energy because those are the verifiable atoms, then
extend to designing the hardware **topology** those circuits run on (`architecture`) and the
quantum **feature map** that classifies data (`classify`) — five task types, each judged the same way.

The chain the harness maintains is: target (stated conceptually in this brief) → submitted
circuit → re-simulated result → constraint check + reproducibility check + threshold check
(each re-derived against the hidden reference) → machine-checkable verdict (an exit code, not prose).

## Who it's for

The public, pointing an autonomous model (today Opus 4.8; built to be READY for Fable 5 /
"Mythos") at a hard quantum design problem and getting back a **machine-checkable verdict** with
the model's autonomy measured from the raw transcript. The model is the designer. The judge is a
**fresh verifier with no stake in the design** — it did not author the circuit and re-derives
every claimed number from scratch on a hermetic pure-numpy simulator. No conversational claim
about a result is admissible; only the exit code of a re-run is.

## Deliverable

A **proof bundle** conforming to `quantum-harness/proof-bundle@1`, one per problem attempted,
that ACCEPTs (exit 0) under `bench/quantum-judge/judge_verify.py`. The bundle is the unit of
work — there is no display-only artifact; every submission is a re-runnable bundle whose verdict
is an exit code.

The schema:

```json
{
  "schema": "quantum-harness/proof-bundle@1",
  "problem_id": "<ghz3 | isingbell2 | bell_pops2 | aiaccel4 | qml_sign1 | ...>",
  "task": "state_prep | vqe | populations | architecture | classify",
  "circuit": { "n_qubits": N, "ops": [ { "gate": "...", "q": [...], "params": [...] } ] },
  "constraints": {
    "n_qubits": N, "max_depth": D,
    "native_gates": [...], "coupling_map": [[i, j], ...], "max_two_qubit_gates": K
  },
  "claim": { "fidelity": F }              // state_prep
       /* or */ { "energy": E }           // vqe
       /* or */ { "populations": [...] }, // populations
  "classical_baseline": { "fidelity": ... | "energy": ..., "note": "..." },
  "meta": {}
}
```

Supported gates (hermetic `sim.py`, qubit 0 = most-significant index): 1-qubit
`x y z h s sdg t tdg sx sxdg rx ry rz p`; 2-qubit `cx cz cy swap crz cp rzz`; 3-qubit `ccx`.
You may author the circuit however you like (Qiskit/Cirq/PennyLane are *optional* adapters), but
the bundle is graded only by the numpy simulator at the verification root — no quantum framework
is required to verify.

### How the verdict is computed — four active gates (first failing gate wins)

Run `python3 bench/quantum-judge/judge_verify.py <bundle.json>`:

| gate | exit | what it proves |
|------|------|----------------|
| STRUCTURE       | 3 | parses; respects `n_qubits`, `max_depth`, `native_gates`, `coupling_map`, `max_two_qubit_gates` |
| REPRODUCIBILITY | 4 | re-simulating reproduces your CLAIMED `fidelity`/`energy` within tolerance (catches fabrication) |
| PERFORMANCE     | 5 | the *recomputed* result meets the threshold AND beats/ties the classical baseline |
| ANTI-OVERFIT   | 6 | held-out generalization check — fires when the problem declares a held-out check; an artifact that matches the VISIBLE spec but fails the HIDDEN held-out observable / workload / test set is REJECTED |
| ACCEPT 0 · schema/parse 2 |||

`capture.py` builds a well-formed bundle from a raw circuit using the SAME simulator if you want
a tool-generated artifact rather than a hand-authored one. `RUBRIC.md` in this directory is the
full grading contract; every criterion there binds to an exit code, a `node --test` assertion,
or an emitted metric — nothing grades on prose.

## The worked targets (committed, runnable today)

These five worked problems are your concrete first deliverables. Each has a committed reference
solution and a committed passing bundle, so you can confirm the bench is green before designing.
Three of them (`bell_pops2`, `aiaccel4`, `qml_sign1`) are anti-overfit demonstrators: each carries
a held-out check — a held-out **observable**, **workload**, or **test set** — that triggers the exit-6 gate.

### Target 1 — `ghz3` (task `state_prep`)

Prepare the **3-qubit GHZ state** `(|000⟩ + |111⟩)/√2` under a **linear `[0-1-2]` coupling map**
(only the pairs `[0,1]` and `[1,2]` may interact directly — there is no direct `0–2` link).

- threshold: `fidelity ≥ 0.99`
- classical baseline to beat/tie: `fidelity 0.5` (the best unentangled product state overlaps GHZ at 0.5)
- depth budget `max_depth 6`, two-qubit cap `max_two_qubit_gates 4`
- reference solution (yields fidelity 1.0): `h q0; cx 0,1; cx 1,2`
- committed passing bundle: `bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-poc.json`

The trap: a naive `h q0; cx 0,1; cx 0,2` would need a direct `0–2` interaction the coupling map
forbids — that routes through STRUCTURE (exit 3). The chain `cx 1,2` respects the linear map.

### Target 2 — `isingbell2` (task `vqe`)

Find the ground state of the 2-qubit Hamiltonian **H = −X₀X₁ − Z₀Z₁** (n=2). The true ground
energy is **E₀ = −2** (a Bell state); the best product/classical state only reaches −1.

- threshold: `energy − E₀ ≤ energy_gap = 0.05` (i.e. recomputed energy must be within 0.05 of −2)
- classical baseline to beat/tie: `energy −1.0`
- depth budget `max_depth 4`, two-qubit cap `max_two_qubit_gates 2`
- reference solution (yields energy −2.0): `h q0; cx 0,1`
- committed passing bundle: `bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-vqe.json`

### Target 3 — `bell_pops2` (task `populations`, the anti-overfit demonstrator)

Prepare the **Bell state** `|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2`. The **visible** spec is its Z-basis
population distribution: **50/50 between `|00⟩` and `|11⟩`** (and 0 elsewhere). The judge
auto-grades that distribution at the reproducibility/performance gates. But the spec is
deliberately **under-determined** — `|Φ⁻⟩ = (|00⟩ − |11⟩)/√2` has the *same* populations — so the
reference **HOLDS OUT** the X-parity **`⟨X₀X₁⟩ = +1`**, which you are never told.

- visible spec: Z-basis populations `[0.5, 0, 0, 0.5]`
- HELD-OUT check (exit 6): `⟨X₀X₁⟩ = +1` (true for `|Φ⁺⟩`, but `−1` for the wrong-phase `|Φ⁻⟩`)
- depth budget `max_depth 4`, two-qubit cap `max_two_qubit_gates 2`
- reference solution (ACCEPTs): `h q0; cx 0,1`
- committed passing bundle: `bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-pops.json`

The trap: a circuit that appends `z q1` produces `|Φ⁻⟩`, whose populations are *still* 50/50, so
it passes STRUCTURE, REPRODUCIBILITY and PERFORMANCE — but its `⟨X₀X₁⟩ = −1` fails the held-out
check and it is REJECTED at ANTI-OVERFIT (exit 6). The committed adversarial fixture
`bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-OVERFIT.json` is exactly that impostor and MUST be rejected at
exit 6 — proving the anti-overfit gate has teeth on a problem that declares a held-out check.

### Target 4 — `aiaccel4` (task `architecture`, held-out WORKLOAD)

Design a **4-qubit hardware coupling map** (a topology, not a circuit) that routes a workload of
required two-qubit interactions under a connectivity budget. The **visible** workload is the
disjoint pairs `[[0,1],[2,3]]`; the judge recomputes a `routing_cost` (sum of shortest-path
distances) on your topology. But the reference **HOLDS OUT** a second workload `[[0,3],[1,2]]`
that the same topology must *also* route within budget — so a design cannot be hand-tuned to the
one workload it could see.

- bundle shape: `{ "architecture": { "n_qubits", "coupling_map": [[i,j]...] }, "constraints": { "max_degree", "connected" }, "claim": { "routing_cost" } }`
- constraints: `max_degree 2`, `connected true`
- threshold: `routing_cost ≤ routing_cost_max` (host-side); classical baseline to beat/tie: `routing_cost 4`
- HELD-OUT check (exit 6): the held-out workload must route at `routing_cost ≤ routing_cost_max`
- reference solution (ACCEPTs): the **ring** `[[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,0]]` — routes both the visible and held-out cross-pairs at distance 1
- committed passing bundle: `bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-arch.json`

The trap: a linear path overfit to the visible disjoint pairs passes STRUCTURE, REPRODUCIBILITY
and PERFORMANCE but blows the held-out cross-pair budget. The committed adversarial fixture
`bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-arch-OVERFIT.json` is exactly that impostor and MUST be
rejected at exit 6.

### Target 5 — `qml_sign1` (task `classify`, held-out TEST set)

Design a **quantum feature map** (n=1) that classifies 1-D data by the sign of `x`. The **visible**
training set is `{(-2,0),(-1,0),(1,1),(2,1)}`; the judge instantiates your feature map per data
point, reads out a Pauli expectation, thresholds it at `bias`, and scores accuracy. But the
reference **HOLDS OUT** a test set placed in the gap between the training points — the textbook
train-vs-test guard.

- bundle shape: `{ "feature_map": { "n_qubits", "ops":[{gate,q,feature?,scale?,params?}] }, "readout": { "pauli", "bias" }, "claim": { "train_accuracy" } }`; a feature-bound op uses `{"feature": idx, "scale": s}` so its angle = `s * x[idx]`
- threshold: `train_accuracy ≥ train_accuracy_min` (host-side: 1.0)
- HELD-OUT check (exit 6): `test_accuracy ≥ test_accuracy_min` on the unseen test set
- reference solution (ACCEPTs): a low-frequency map `Ry(x)` with `⟨X⟩` readout — `⟨X⟩ = sin(x)`, decision boundary `x=0`, which generalizes
- committed passing bundle: `bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-qml.json`

The trap: a high-frequency map `Ry(7x)` nails the four training points but oscillates and
misclassifies the held-out test — it passes STRUCTURE, REPRODUCIBILITY and PERFORMANCE but is
REJECTED at ANTI-OVERFIT. The committed adversarial fixture
`bench/quantum-judge/quantum-proof-qml-OVERFIT.json` is exactly that impostor and MUST be
rejected at exit 6.

You are told the Hamiltonian and the GHZ target **conceptually, here**. The exact target
amplitude vector, the exact Hamiltonian terms, and the numeric thresholds live **host-side** with
the judge in `bench/quantum-judge/references/<problem_id>.json` — the analog of a signing key that
never enters the sandbox. The judge reads ground truth from there, NEVER from your bundle, and
recomputes `⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩` (vqe) or the state overlap (state_prep) itself. In this public template the
references are committed so CI is exercisable; in a real contest they are HELD OUT and the judge
is pointed at them via `QH_REFERENCES_DIR`. Because the judge re-derives every claimed number
from the hidden reference and the circuit IR cannot embed a target state, a circuit tuned to a
number you embedded in the bundle, rather than to the true target, is caught at the
REPRODUCIBILITY (exit 4) / PERFORMANCE (exit 5) gates. On top of that, problems whose reference
declares a `holdout` block (e.g. `bell_pops2`, `aiaccel4`, `qml_sign1`) add a dedicated
**ANTI-OVERFIT gate (exit 6)**: the judge grades the visible spec at gates 4/5 and then checks a
HELD-OUT observable / workload / test set you were never told — an artifact that matches only the
part it could see is REJECTED at exit 6. For problems that declare no `holdout` block (`ghz3`,
`isingbell2`) anti-overfit additionally holds by construction (ground truth lives only in the
hidden reference and the IR cannot embed a target), so exit 6 is simply not triggered for them.

## What done looks like (the rubric is the contract)

`RUBRIC.md` in this directory. A fresh verifier sub-agent must be able to grade every criterion
without a human. Do not stop while any R criterion fails; do not declare done without a verifier
pass. Concretely, for this session:

- the worked bundles ACCEPT (exit 0): `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-poc.json`,
  `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-vqe.json`, `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-pops.json`,
  `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-arch.json`, and `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-qml.json`;
- the anti-overfit impostors are REJECTED at exit 6: `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-OVERFIT.json`,
  `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-arch-OVERFIT.json`, and `judge_verify.py quantum-proof-qml-OVERFIT.json`;
- the bench self-test is green: `python3 bench/quantum-judge/test_judge.py` → `29/29 checks passed`;
- the measurement suite is green: `node --test test/*.test.mjs` → 82 tests pass, 0 fail;
- the same bundles still ACCEPT when the references are relocated via `QH_REFERENCES_DIR` to a
  directory outside your tree (anti-overfit, proven not assumed).

## Hard rules

- **Respect the declared constraints, always.** Honor `n_qubits`, `max_depth`, `native_gates`,
  the `coupling_map`, and `max_two_qubit_gates` exactly as the bundle declares them. A two-qubit
  gate on a pair not in the coupling map, a non-native gate, an over-budget depth, a qubit-count
  mismatch, or exceeding the 2q cap is a STRUCTURE failure (exit 3) — the circuit is rejected
  before its result is scored. Constraint-respecting is the whole point: an unrunnable circuit is
  not a solution.
- **No fabricated claims — the judge recomputes.** Your `claim.fidelity` / `claim.energy` is
  decorative until the judge re-simulates it. If the recomputed number disagrees with your claim,
  the bundle is REJECTED at REPRODUCIBILITY (exit 4). The committed adversarial fixture
  `quantum-proof-FORGED.json` — which omits the second CX so its true GHZ fidelity is 0.25 yet
  claims 1.0 — MUST be rejected at exit 4. Do not type a result; let the judge compute it.
- **Ground truth is hidden.** You know each target only CONCEPTUALLY from this brief. The exact
  target statevector / Hamiltonian terms / thresholds are held out with the judge under
  `references/<problem_id>.json` and may be relocated via `QH_REFERENCES_DIR`. Design to the
  *true target* described here, not to any number you can read in a committed bundle — the
  judge re-derives every claimed number against that hidden reference, so a number you fit to your
  own bundle is caught at REPRODUCIBILITY (exit 4) / PERFORMANCE (exit 5).
- **Beat or tie the classical baseline.** Meeting the threshold is necessary but not sufficient:
  the recomputed result must also beat/tie the bundle's stated `classical_baseline`
  (GHZ: 0.5; isingbell2: −1) or it fails PERFORMANCE (exit 5). The point of these problems is the
  entanglement a classical product state cannot reach.
- **Run the bench yourself; self-correct until green.** One kickoff, then loop: submit a bundle,
  read the exit code, fix the circuit, re-submit. A failure you catch with the judge (or
  `test_judge.py`, or `node --test`) before any human points it out is the autonomy this harness
  measures — the transcript scorecard surfaces it.
- **Credentials never appear in output; the transcript ships PUBLIC** (after a secret scan).
  Reference env var names only; treat every byte you emit as judge-visible.
- **State limits honestly.** The simulator is pure-numpy statevector — no noise model, no shots;
  references are committed in this template but held out in a real contest. Mislabeling, in either
  direction, is a disqualification.
